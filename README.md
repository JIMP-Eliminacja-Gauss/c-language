# Custom Programming Language

Welcome to the repository for our custom programming language! This project defines a simple yet expressive language using ANTLR grammar, allowing for variable declarations, arithmetic operations, boolean expressions, input/output operations, and array handling.

## Features
- **Variable Declarations**: Supports `int`, `double`, `bool`, and `array` types.
- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Boolean Expressions**: Logical operations such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), XOR (`!=`), and equality (`==`).
- **Input/Output Operations**: Read input (`read()`) and print values (`print()`).
- **Array Handling**: Declare, initialize, assign values, and allocate memory dynamically.

## Example Code
```c
int x = 10;
double y = 5.5;
bool flag = true;
print(x + y);
array int numbers = {1, 2, 3};
numbers[1] = 5;
print(numbers[1]);
```
